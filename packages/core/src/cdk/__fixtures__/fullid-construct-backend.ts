/**
 * Test fixture: a child Scope that embeds its `fullId` directly into a CDK
 * construct ID.
 *
 * Why this matters
 * ----------------
 * Building Blocks routinely use their `fullId` as part of a construct ID, e.g.
 * a DSQL block creating its migration Lambda as
 * `new lambda.NodejsFunction(stack, `${this.fullId}DsqlMigrationFn`, ...)`.
 * CDK forbids unresolved tokens in construct IDs (it throws
 * "ID components may not include unresolved tokens" at synth time).
 *
 * `fullId` is derived from the enclosing stack name. In a nested-stack topology
 * (e.g. Amplify Gen2's `backend.createStack('blocks')`) that stack name is a
 * deploy-time token, so a naive `fullId` would carry a token and break synth.
 *
 * This fixture reproduces that exact pattern: importing it builds a construct
 * whose ID is `${this.fullId}Marker`. If `fullId` ever contains a token, this
 * side-effect import throws at synth time — which is what the test asserts must
 * NOT happen.
