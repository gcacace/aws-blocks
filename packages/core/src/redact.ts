/**
 * Sensitive-field redaction for logging.
 *
 * The dev server logs RPC request/response bodies to help debug cross-stack
 * wire-format mismatches. Those bodies carry credentials (sign-in passwords,
 * new-password challenge responses) and bearer-style secrets (Cognito challenge
 * `session` tokens, MFA shared secrets, OTP codes). Logging them verbatim puts
 * plaintext passwords and reusable tokens in the log stream. This module masks
 * those fields before anything is logged, without mutating the value that
 * actually flows over the wire.
 *
 * Two complementary rules, because auth payloads hide secrets two ways:
 *
 *  1. **Direct keys** — `{ password: '...', session: '...' }`. Redacted by
 *     field NAME, matched case-insensitively (substring).
 *
 *  2. **Form-field descriptors** — the auth state machine ships secrets as
 *     `{ name: 'session', defaultValue: '<token>' }` (see
 *     `@aws-blocks/auth-common` AuthField). Here the secret sits under the
 *     innocuous key `defaultValue`; the sensitive word is the *value* of a
 *     sibling `name`. Rule 1 alone would walk straight past it. So when an
 *     object carries a sensitive `name`, its `defaultValue` is redacted too.
 *
 * The wire payload is never altered — only the logged copy is scrubbed.
 */

 * payloads in `@aws-blocks/auth-common` plus the generic credential vocabulary.
