# AWS Blocks App (bare)

Minimal full-stack TypeScript app with the AWS Blocks framework.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev          # Start local dev server (mocks, no AWS needed)
npm run test:e2e     # Run API tests
npm run sandbox      # Deploy to AWS sandbox
```

Open http://localhost:3000 after `npm run dev`.

## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `aws-blocks/index.ts` | Backend: APIs and Building Blocks |
| `src/index.ts` | Frontend: imports backend APIs directly |
| `test/e2e.test.ts` | Tests: verifies API via direct imports |
| `index.html` | HTML shell |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Local dev with mock storage |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Test API via direct imports |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run sandbox` | Deploy backend to AWS, serve frontend locally |
| `npm run deploy` | Full production deploy |
| `npm run sandbox:destroy` | Tear down sandbox resources |

## For Agents

**Do not use local files or in-memory storage** — use Building Blocks for all data persistence and cloud abstractions (they mock locally and deploy to AWS automatically).

Start in `aws-blocks/index.ts` (backend) and `src/index.ts` (frontend). Test via `npm run test:e2e`. The API transport (JSON-RPC) is auto-generated and intentionally invisible — do not curl endpoints directly. Testing is best done through the e2e tests which use the same typed client as the frontend.
