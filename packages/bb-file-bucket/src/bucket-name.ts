 * S3 bucket-name validation, shared by the CDK (synth) and mock (local dev)
 * entry points so a name that would be rejected by CloudFormation fails the
 * same way during `bb dev` — long before a deploy is attempted.
 *
 * Bucket names are derived from the scope chain (`scope.fullId`). Because S3
 * bucket names are globally unique and immutable, we deliberately error rather
 * than silently truncate/hash: a truncated name could collide, and a name that
 * shifts between deploys would orphan or replace the customer's data. The fix
 * belongs in the developer's hands — shorten a scope id once and the name is
 * stable forever.
 *
 * Rules enforced (AWS general-purpose bucket naming):
 * - 3–63 characters
 * - lowercase letters, numbers, dots (`.`), and hyphens (`-`) only
 * - must begin and end with a letter or number
 * - must not contain two adjacent dots
 *
 * @see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html
